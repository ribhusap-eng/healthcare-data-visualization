# Healthcare Data Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes patterns in healthcare data using advanced visualization techniques to identify trends in patient admissions, medical conditions, billing amounts, and medications.

## Dataset
The dataset is a synthetic healthcare dataset obtained from Kaggle:
- [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset/data)
- Variables include:
  - Patient demographics (e.g., Age, Date of Admission)
  - Medical conditions (e.g., Arthritis, Diabetes, Cancer)
  - Medications (e.g., Aspirin, Lipitor)
  - Billing Amounts and Insurance Providers

## Visualizations
1. **Chord Diagram**:
   - Shows relationships between medical conditions and medications.
2. **Mosaic Plot**:
   - Depicts distribution of medical conditions across years of admission.
3. **Calendar Heatmap**:
   - Highlights admission patterns over years, months, and days.
4. **Heatmap**:
   - Compares average billing amounts by insurance providers and medical conditions.
5. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Analyzes billing amounts based on test results.
6. **2D Density Plot**:
   - Visualizes billing amounts by age groups for specific medical conditions.
